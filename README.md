- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattcantstop

I live in the Denver, Colorado area and am from New England. 

### Work experience

- **ReSim:** Professional Services at [ReSim](https://resim.ai). 
- **Spoonme.kitchen:** Still building a company in the consumer app space called Spoonme. We have an Elixir backend and a Swift iOS app. [Check it out here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/food-journal-spoonme/id6483933170)
- **LaunchDarkly:** I was previously at [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com). I was brought to LaunchDarkly to build the Professional Services organization.
- **GitHub:** I worked at GitHub for seven years helping to build the Professional Services Delivery organization. I started as an Implementation Engineer and ended up leading the Delivery organization, which consisted of, at varying times, DevOps Engineers, Solution Architects, Implementation Engineers, a migration engineering team, GitHub's Advanced Security Services team, trainers, and operations. GitHub was a really special place to work. I consider myself lucky that I was able to work there on that (this!) product, with those people, at that time :heart:
- **MX:** I worked at [MX](https://mx.com) for three years. I started as a Ruby engineer but spent the majority of my time there as an Implementation Engineer working with banks, credit unions, and online banking providers as they integrated MX's software, primarily through APIs.
