- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattcantstop

I live in the Denver, Colorado area and am from New England. 

### Work experience

- **LaunchDarkly:** I work at [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com). I am building the Professional Services organization. 
- **GitHub:** I worked at GitHub for seven years helping to build the Professional Services Delivery organization. I started as an Implementation Engineer and end up leading the Delivery organization, which consisted of, at varying times, DevOps Engineers, Solution Architects, Implementation Engineers, a migration engineering team, GitHub's Advanced Security Services team, and operations. 
- **MX:** I worked at [MX](https://mx.com) for three years. I started as a Ruby engineer but spent the majority of my time there as an Implementation Engineer working with banks, credit unions, and online banking providers as they integrated MX's software, primarily through APIs.
